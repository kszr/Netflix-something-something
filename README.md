# Netflix-something-something
I have some idea of what I want to do with this project. It remains to be seen whether available Netflix and IMDb APIs will let me do it. I suspect they won't.

###A note on available APIs and applications

1. Netflix no longer offers a public API.
2. Netflix APIs that have survived the purge are of very limited utility. For example, Netflix Roulette does not let you search by id or genre, and offers little in the way of documentation for its API.  
3. Open source IMDb APIs like OMDb have the same problem. For some reason it never crossed anyone's mind that people might sometimes like to browse genres.
5. Netflix and IMDb have different names for the same movies.
6. Existing programs that purport to do what this project aims to do (e.g., [whatisonnetflix.com](whatisonnetflix.com)) in fact don't.

These and other aspects of existing APIs will doubtless make this project infeasible.
